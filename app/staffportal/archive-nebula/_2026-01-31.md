Project Name: Nebula Engine 2026

Vision: Evolution from a static "Yggdrasil" portal to a dynamic, metadata-driven Galaxy Framework. The UI is no longer hardcoded; it is a reflection of JSON manifests served by the Backend (CAP).

I. The Hierarchy:

Galaxy (Global Level): Managed by the GalaxyMap JSON. Defines available star systems (Pages) and global settings (Theme, Language).

System (Page Level): Managed by PageLayout JSON. Defines the spatial arrangement (Layout) and the population of planets.

Planet (Card Level): Atomic Integration Cards (Component type).

II. Architecture Components:

Identity Oracle: A startup UI5 Fragment/Dialog for role selection (Admin, Manager, Basic). Sets the gravitational constant for the session.

The Nebula Forge (Shell.controller): * Orchestrator: Fetches configuration from CAP.

Layout Engine: Clears and populates the galaxyCore (VBox/Grid) dynamically.

Forge Method: _forgeCard(oConfig) — standardizes card instantiation with injected parameters.

CAP Backend (Control Center): * Implements RBAC (Role-Based Access Control).

Filters JSON manifests based on the user's role before sending to the client.

III. Error Management & Resilience:

The Void Pattern: A robust try-catch wrapper around card creation. If a "Planet" fails to load or the JSON is "malformed", the system renders an IllustratedMessage (404/Error state) ensuring the rest of the Galaxy remains functional.

IV. Roadmap:

Phase 1: Core Assembly (Identity Dialog -> Navigation Injection -> Vertical Layout).

Phase 2: Multi-role Backend Logic (CAP Service).

Phase 3: Advanced Sprawl (Complex Layouts, Cross-card communication).
